      I grew up in the capital of Nepal, surrounded by mountains. My parents went to the U.S. for half a year. They
      returned to come get me and bring me with them, and we started a whole new life in the U.S., so I’ve been living
      here for about 13 years. I’m currently going to be a senior in high school, which is both terrifying and exciting.

        <h2>Personality
      </strong></h2>
      I think I’m kind of an introvert, but when I’m more comfortable with my close friends and family. I feel like I’m
      a calm person in general, and I really care about others.

          <li>I basically listen to music everyday. I have played a couple of instruments in my life, but I mainly enjoy
            playing the guitar and singing. </li>
          <li>I love the feeling of going to new places and taking in the beauty of nature and our world!</li>
          <li>One of my favorite pastimes is hanging out with my friends. </li>
          <li>When I have nothing to do, I just watch random shows and movies. My favorite movie is probably “10 Things
            I Hate About You.” </li>
          <li>Sleeping is something I can do anytime, anywhere!<br><img

        <h2>Goals
      </strong></h2>
      I still have no idea what my career will be or what I’m going to do with my life. However, I do know that I want
      to make an impact in the world by helping people and the environment, and I also hope to travel a lot!
